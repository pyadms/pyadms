Requires bison, flex, and a C++ 11 compliant compiler.  Tested on Mac OS X and Ubuntu 12.04.  Changes for other systems should probably be done in admsJSON/CMakeLists.txt.

cd ..
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG ..
make

admsJSON should be in adms/build/admsJSON

Tests may be run using:
ctest -j2
where 2 may be replaced by the number of desired processes.

To run an individual test:
cd ngspice/ekv
../../build/admsJSON/admsJSON -I ../include -oekv.json -fekv.va
